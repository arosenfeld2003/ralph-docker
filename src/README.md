# Example Application Source

This is an example `src/` directory structure to demonstrate how Ralph Docker works with YOUR application code.

## Directory Structure

- `lib/` - Shared utilities and helper functions
- `services/` - Business logic and service layer
- `models/` - Data models and schemas

## Usage

1. Replace this example with YOUR actual application code
2. Update the prompts in `prompts/` to match your directory structure
3. Write your specifications in `specs/`
4. Run Ralph Docker to start automated development

## Note

This is just an example structure. Your actual application may have:
- Different directory names (app/, packages/, etc.)
- Different organization (MVC, microservices, monorepo)
- Different languages and frameworks

The key is to update the prompt files to reference YOUR structure.
